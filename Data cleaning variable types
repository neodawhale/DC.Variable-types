1. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of treating the Rank variable as categorical. 

The rank variable is among the ordinal variables. It tells us the number one spot is 1st place, the number two spot is 2nd place, the 
number three spot is third best, and so on. The advantages of treating the rank variable as categorical is having the best on top and 
going down in descending order. The disadvantages of having it treated as categorical is looking at it as a nominal variable. Doing that 
puts the ranking in random order, making it difficult to find which is the better person when searching.


2. What are the types of the following variables?

-Age = Categorical or (both?). Depends on what we are looking for. If we are looking for the difference in age groups, we want to 
treat it as an ratio continuous variable. Or, it can be nominal categorical since we are
taking the given number of people that exist.

-Salary = Ordinal Categorical. People pay rate is another form of rank??

-Revenue = Ratio Continuous. Company, businesses etc revenues are always changing. If a company's revenue reaches the meaningful value
of $0, there will be no business. 

-Customer type = Nominal Categorical. Using the given number of people, we can use a survey to collect the types of customers. The order
of the customer type would not matter since we arent ranking.

-Stock price = Ratio Continuous variable. stock price always change. However, if a company reaches the absolute zero value, then all
of the company's value is lost.
