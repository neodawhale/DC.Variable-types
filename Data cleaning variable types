1. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of treating the Rank variable as categorical. 

The rank variable is among the ordinal variables. It tells us the number one spot is 1st place, the number two spot is 2nd place, the 
number three spot is third best, and so on. The advantages of treating the rank variable as categorical is having the best on top and 
going down in descending order. The disadvantages of having it treated as categorical is looking at it as a nominal variable. Doing that 
puts the ranking in random order, making it difficult to find which is the better person when searching.


2. What are the types of the following variables?

-Age = Categorical or (both?). Depends on what we are looking for. If we are looking for the difference in age groups, we want to 
treat it as an interval variable. 

-Salary = Categorical. People pay rate is another form of rank??

-Revenue = Continuous, Company, businesses etc revenues are always changing.

-Customer type = Categorical, nominal variable. The order of customer type may not matter when collecting this type of data. You may find 
out the customer type from surveys and such.

-Stock price = Continuous, stock price always change. A ratio variable.
